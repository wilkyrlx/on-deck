# CS32 Term Project
## Project Overview
Our project, On Deck! aims to solve the problem of sports fan encountering too much information in their daily lives and failing to keep track of all the games they may want to watch. This is a problem that all of us (the project developers) have experienced, as have many of our friends and the potential users weâ€™ve interviewed. Our solution solves this problem by allowing users to input their preferences and get out a definitive schedule of what to watch and when. Our service provides all the information they need for that purpose, and nothing more. The desired information is quickly accessible and easy to understand. Other sports sites, such as ESPN and Bleacher Report, also list out all the active games, but this information is spread out, generally not personalized, and infiltrated with ads, videos, and articles.
